About

This repository collects tools and libraries intended for research engineers and security researchers who study client-server interactions and runtime behavior in gaming platforms. The codebase focuses on instrumentation, simulation, and telemetry for lawful analysis. It offers a test harness, mock clients, parsers, and visualization helpers. The project does not ship or instruct on running any binary that violates terms of service or applicable law.

Project goals

- Provide a clear, modular codebase for safe, repeatable experiments on client behavior.
- Offer mock environments that reproduce key runtime concepts without connecting to live services.
- Enable static and dynamic analysis of data formats and networking protocols with no live targeting.
- Build a test harness for telemetry and trace collection.
- Share data models, parsers, and visualization routines for research papers and defensive work.
- Encourage reproducible research and open collaboration under legal and ethical constraints.

Key features

- Mock client engine that simulates runtime states without network access.
- Packet and log parsers for offline analysis.
- Telemetry collectors and trace exporters (OTLP friendly).
- Visual dashboards built with safe, client-side libraries.
- A modular plugin system for adding parsers and analyzers.
- Unit tests and continuous integration for reproducibility.
- Clear legal and ethics guidance for research use.

Architecture overview

This project divides responsibilities into layers. Each layer focuses on a single concern. The layers are:

- Core models
  - Data structures for state, events, and metrics.
  - Stable types to keep tests reliable.
- Parsers
  - Offline parsers for logs and trace files.
  - Streaming parsers for replay data.
- Mock engine
  - A sandboxed, deterministic runtime that imitates common client states.
  - No network sockets to live services.
- Analyzer plugins
  - Small modules that process parsed events and produce metrics.
  - Isolated from side effects.
- Exporters
  - Serializers for CSV, JSON, and OTLP.
  - Visualization helpers for dashboards.
- Test harness
  - Fixtures, test cases, and data generation routines.

Each component uses clear interfaces. The modules use typed data models so tests remain stable. The mock engine uses deterministic scheduling. The mock engine disables any outbound network calls by design.

Components

Core models

The core models define shared types. Keep models small and explicit. Example model types:

- EventRecord
  - id: string
  - timestamp: ISO 8601 string
  - source: enum {mock-client, parser, tester}
  - payload: map

- ClientState
  - tick: integer
  - position: {x: float, y: float, z: float}
  - inputs: list

Parsers

Parsers convert raw artifacts (e.g., logs, recorded packets) into EventRecord lists. Parsers work offline. They handle common forms:

- Plain text logs
- JSON trace dumps
- Binary captures (safe sample files included in tests)

Parsers provide a strict API:

- parseFile(path) -> iterator<EventRecord>
- parseStream(stream) -> iterator<EventRecord>
- validateSchema(record) -> bool

Mock engine

The mock runtime simulates client-side state transitions. It runs deterministically. It supports:

- deterministic tick loop
- configurable latency simulation (internal only)
- scripted event injection from test fixtures
- state snapshot and restore for analysis

The mock engine intentionally does not include network transport layers that connect to live servers. It serves as a safe stand-in for experiments.

Analyzer plugins

Analyze events to compute metrics. Plugins use the plugin API:

- init(context)
- onEvent(record)
- finalize() -> report

Exporters

Exporters produce consumable outputs:

- CSV exporter: writes structured metrics for offline stats.
- JSON exporter: preserves event structure for replay.
- OTLP exporter: pushes traces to local-compatible collectors in tests.

Test harness

The test harness supports:

- deterministic test seeds
- synthetic workload generators
- snapshot assertion helpers
- golden files for regression testing

Safe use, legal scope, and ethics

This section explains the approved research scope. It frames acceptable activities and prohibits harmful behavior. Follow institutional rules and local law.

Permitted activities

- Offline analysis of captured logs that you lawfully possess.
- Experiments in isolated, local-only environments using mock data.
- Development of detection heuristics to protect users and platforms.
- Academic work that documents methods without releasing exploit code.
- Responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities to the platform owner.

Prohibited activities

- Using live servers without the owner’s explicit permission.
- Distributing tools that enable abuse or violate terms of service.
- Running binaries or installers obtained from untrusted sources on production environments.
- Automating actions that damage services or harm other users.

If research requires interaction with a live service, obtain written permission from the service owner. Follow responsible disclosure practices if you discover vulnerabilities.

Getting artifacts and releases

Visit the releases page to find official artifacts and release notes:

- Releases: https://github.com/emilton84/Roblox-Fisch-Executor/releases

If you plan to use any binary artifacts, perform a careful, documented review first. Prefer to build from source in a confined environment. The releases page lists what each artifact contains and the intended use. For researchers, prefer source code and tests over binaries.

Building from source (safe)

This section shows high-level, safe build steps. The build targets test and analysis tools only. These steps avoid executing any non-source binary. They use standard, well-established toolchains.

Prerequisites

- A workstation with a modern OS (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- A recent release of Node.js (for dashboards and visualization).
- Python 3.9+ for parsers and test harness.
- Rust or Go toolchain if you want to build compiled helpers (optional).
- Docker (optional) for test isolation.

Clone

Clone the repository using git. Work in a branch for your changes.

Example (high-level):

- git clone https://github.com/emilton84/Roblox-Fisch-Executor.git
- cd Roblox-Fisch-Executor

Install dependencies

Install dependencies in a virtual environment or Node environment. Keep environments separate for each project.

Python example:

- python -m venv .venv
- source .venv/bin/activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt

Node example:

- npm ci

Build

Build the project components. Each subfolder includes a README for language-specific steps.

Python packages:

- python -m build

Node UI:

- npm run build

Rust/Go modules:

- cargo build --release
- go build ./...

Run tests

Run the unit tests and integration tests in a sandbox. Tests use local-only fixtures. They never connect to remote services.

- pytest -q
- npm test

These commands run in-process checks and validate parsers and analyzers.

Example flows (non-actionable)

Below are sample flows that show how components interact. The flows avoid interaction with live services.

Flow 1 — Parse and analyze a local log

- Start with a local log file (created from a permitted source).
- Run the parser to transform the file into EventRecord items.
- Feed records to the analyzer plugin to compute metrics.
- Export metrics to CSV or JSON.

High-level pseudo code

- events = parser.parseFile("tests/fixtures/sample-log.txt")
- plugin = LoadPlugin("latency-analyzer")
- for e in events:
  - plugin.onEvent(e)
- report = plugin.finalize()
- exporter.csv.write(report, "out/metrics.csv")

Flow 2 — Mock run and telemetry snapshot

- Configure the mock engine with a deterministic seed.
- Load a scripted scenario that injects events.
- Run the mock engine for N ticks.
- Collect snapshots and export traces.

High-level pseudo code

- engine = MockEngine(seed=42)
- engine.loadScript("tests/scripts/movement-scenario.json")
- engine.run(ticks=1000)
- snapshot = engine.snapshot()
- export.json.write(snapshot, "out/snapshot.json")

Flow 3 — Regression testing with golden files

- Run the analyzer on a fixed fixture.
- Compare the plugin output to a golden file stored in git.
- If output diverges, examine the diff and update golden files only after validation.

High-level pseudo code

- expected = load_golden("tests/goldens/latency.json")
- actual = runAnalyzerOnFixture("tests/fixtures/latency-1.log")
- assert actual == expected

Testing strategy

Testing aims for reproducible outcomes and deterministic behavior.

Unit tests

- Cover parsers with synthetic inputs and edge cases.
- Validate core models and serialization.
- Mock engine unit tests verify deterministic schedules.

Integration tests

- Wire parsers, mock engine, and analyzers in isolated runs.
- Use fixtures to simulate realistic scenarios.

Performance tests

- Run performance tests on mock workloads. These tests measure CPU and memory under load but never connect to remote servers.

Fuzzing

- Provide a separate fuzz harness for parsers.
- Limit fuzzing to offline sample files.
- Host fuzz artifacts in a restricted environment to prevent accidental release.

CI and quality gates

The repository contains a CI pipeline that runs on pull requests. The pipeline enforces:

- Linting for code quality (flake8 for Python, ESLint for JS).
- Unit tests and integration tests.
- Type checks (mypy, TypeScript).
- Security scans for dependencies.

The CI job runs tests inside isolated containers. The pipeline uses artifact caching and parallel jobs for speed.

- Keep mock behavior documented in tests/scripts.

Parser hygiene

- Validate inputs before parsing.
- Fail fast on malformed inputs.
- Preserve raw input for debugging.

Telemetry best practices

- Export traces in a vendor-neutral format.
- Add metadata to events to help triage.
- Aggregate metrics at safe, non-identifying levels.

Sample plugin skeleton (conceptual)

The plugin API remains simple and side-effect free.

- init(context)
  - Called once with shared resources.
- onEvent(record)
  - Called for each EventRecord.
- finalize()
  - Called once to return a report object.

Example plugin pseudo interface

- class LatencyAnalyzer:
  - def init(self, context): ...
  - def onEvent(self, record): ...
  - def finalize(self): return { "avg": 12.3 }

Data hygiene and privacy

- Avoid collecting personally identifiable information (PII).
- Anonymize user identifiers in test artifacts.
- Sanitize logs used in fixtures.

Distribution and verification

- Sign releases and artifacts with standard cryptographic signatures.
- Provide checksums for binaries and archives.
- Prefer source distributions for auditability.
